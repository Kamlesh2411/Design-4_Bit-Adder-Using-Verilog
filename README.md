# Design-4_Bit-Adder-Using-Verilog

Project Name:- 4-Bit Adder Design Using Verilog

Problem Statement:- To create a combinational circuit capable of adding two 4-bit binary numbers along with a carry input.

How I Solved It:- Implemented a 1-bit Full Adder as the building block, cascading them to form a 4-bit adder. Designed and verified the Verilog code using a testbench, ensuring correct outputs under various input conditions.

Technology Used:- Verilog HDL and simulation tools. This project demonstrates expertise in digital logic design, modular circuit implementation, and foundational arithmetic unit development.
