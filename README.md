# Design-4_Bit-Adder-Using-Verilog

The 4-Bit Adder Design using Verilog project involved implementing a combinational circuit that performs binary addition of two 4-bit numbers along with a carry input. 
The design consisted of modular components, utilizing a 1-bit Full Adder as the building block. These Full Adders were cascaded to handle the 4-bit addition, 
producing a 4-bit sum output and a carry output. The Verilog code was simulated and verified using a testbench, ensuring correct functionality under various input conditions.
This project demonstrates foundational expertise in digital logic design, modular circuit development, and hardware description using Verilog HDL. It is essential for applications in arithmetic units and digital system design.
